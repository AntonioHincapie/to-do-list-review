# to-do-list

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. I will build a simple website that allows for doing that, and I will do it using ES6 and Webpack!

## Built With

- Webpack and modules.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Boilerplate for HTML
- Linters for HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

I will build a very simple yet powerful to-do list. It will be inspired by the minimalist website. That website is already offline but you can still play with thanks to web.archive.org.

### Prerequisites

Node.js
npm

### Setup

Install modules from webpack

### Install

Webpack modules for Lodash, HTML Plugin, Web Server, Style, Local Linters from Microverse.
